## **üìÇ Project Overview**

- **Topic**: **Ensemble Text Summarization Algorithm Using Transformer Models**  
- **Objective**: Develop an efficient summarization system leveraging state-of-the-art transformer models to generate fluent, accurate, and coherent summaries for diverse text domains.

---

## **Abstract**  
The exponential rise of digital content calls for robust summarization solutions. This project introduces an **ensemble-based summarization algorithm** leveraging pre-trained transformer models‚Äî**BART, PEGASUS, and RoBERTa**. With a custom dataset of 200,000 summary-article pairs, BART and PEGASUS were fine-tuned incrementally, while RoBERTa facilitated semantic similarity assessment to ensure coherence and reduce redundancy. Evaluated using ROUGE metrics, the system demonstrated high performance and scalability. Deployed via Streamlit, this solution offers an accessible tool for diverse real-world applications.
